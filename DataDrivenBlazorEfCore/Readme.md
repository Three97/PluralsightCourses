> Blazor Server and Entity Framework Core are a popular combination to build data-driven web applications, because there's no need to implement a web API. Instead, you can access the database directly from your Blazor Server application by using EF Core. In this course, Building a Data-driven ASP.NET Core 6 Blazor Server Application with EF Core, you’ll learn how to build a data-driven web application from start to finish. First, you'll create the initial Blazor Server project and you'll set up Entity Framework Core. Next, you'll learn how to read and show employees in a paginated table and you will learn how to implement the components to add, edit, and delete an employee. Finally, you’ll learn how to handle concurrency conflicts in your Blazor Server application. These conflicts can happen when multiple users are working with your application. When you’re finished with this course, you’ll have the skills and knowledge of Blazor Server and Entity Framework Core needed to build data-driven web applications with .NET and C#.
